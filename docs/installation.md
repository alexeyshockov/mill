# Installation

Mill was built for automatically generating the [Vimeo API](https://developer.vimeo.com/api/endpoints) documentation microsite. It can compile your API documentation down into an [OpenAPI 3.0](https://swagger.io/),  [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org), specification, and also automatically generated [changelogs](https://developer.vimeo.com/api/changelog).

As it was built specifically for the Vimeo API, it may come off as opinionated, and may not be a good fit for all types of APIs, however we've put a lot of effort to make it as generalized as possible.

You can install Mill through the use of [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).

```shell
$ composer require vimeo/mill
```

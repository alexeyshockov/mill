Mill is an annotation-based DSL for documenting a REST API.

It was built for automatically generating the [Vimeo API](https://developer.vimeo.com/api/endpoints) documentation microsite, and can be compiled down into [OpenAPI 3.0](https://swagger.io/) or [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/) specifications.

As it was built specifically for the Vimeo API, it is **very** opinionated, and may not be a good fit for all types of APIs.

### Installation
```
composer require vimeo/mill
```

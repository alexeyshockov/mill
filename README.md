### What is Mill?
Mill is a PHP library for documenting a REST API with a small annotation DSL.

It was built for automatically generating the [Vimeo API](https://developer.vimeo.com/api/endpoints) documentation
microsite, and can be compiled down into [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/) files.

As it was built specifically for the Vimeo API, it is **very** opinionated, and may not be a good fit for all types of
APIs.
